    "We will first start by dropping rows that contain null values in the box_office_df then standardise the foreign and domestic gross column by dividing by 1,000,000 for easier viewing of data. Next, we will add the foreign and domestic gross column together and create a new column called total_revenue. This will help us in our analysis. We will also turn the relevant database tables into DataFrames so we can carry out operations on them using pandas."
